============================= DATE: Nov 10, 2025 =======

- Learned core filesystem path indicators:
  / (root), ~ (home), . (current directory), .. (parent directory).

- Understood the difference between absolute and relative pathnames:
  absolute paths start at '/', relative paths resolve from the current directory.

- Reviewed Linux users and privileges:
  each user has a private home directory; access depends on ownership and permissions.

- Practiced switching users correctly:
  “su - username” loads the target user’s environment; cd alone cannot enter another user’s home.
